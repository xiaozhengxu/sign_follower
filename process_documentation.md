In the first iteration, the u-turn image and right-turn image matched correctly with the templates, but not the left turn image, as shown in the first run in the terminal output image below. 
Then I tried cropping the left-turn scene to include only the sign. After this, the left-turn image also matched correctly with the template, as shown in the second run in the terminal output image below:
